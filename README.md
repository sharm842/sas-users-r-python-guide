# Sas-users-r-python-guide
Welcome! Here I will post easy-to-follow codes for anyone who wants to learn R and Python, especially for epidemiologists who are new to coding or moving from SAS.  This page is designed for people who don’t have a strong background in coding, I am not a programming expert or a deep diver into coding languages—I am an epidemiologist and a PhD student. I use these codes mainly for statistical analysis and everyday data tasks in my research. I will share only the basics and practical tips that I use in my daily PhD life.

For each code example, I will include:

A simple explanation in plain English

What you can achieve with that code

Step-by-step instructions, when needed

The goal is to make coding practical and approachable for epidemiologists and other researchers who just want to get their work done—no advanced coding knowledge required.

If you have any questions, or if you want to see an example for your own research, feel free to reach out. Happy learning!
