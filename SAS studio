Beginner Guide: Getting Started with SAS Studio
SAS Studio is a free, browser-based tool for running SAS code. It’s popular among epidemiologists and public health researchers for data analysis and statistics.

1. What is SAS Studio?
An online tool to write and run SAS code: You can access it from any web browser.

No installation needed: Great for beginners and students.

2. How to Start Using SAS Studio
Go to SAS OnDemand for Academics.

Click “Sign in” (create a free account if you don’t have one).

After logging in, click “Start SAS Studio”.

3. Understanding the Interface
Code Window (Editor): Type your SAS code here.

Log: Shows messages, errors, and whether your code worked.

Results: Shows tables, charts, and outputs.

Navigation Pane: See your files and datasets.

4. Writing and Running SAS Code
Type this in the Code Window and click the “Run” button (the little running man icon):

/* Assign values to variables */
data mydata;
  a = 3;
  b = 4;
  c = a + b;         /* Adds a and b, stores result in c */
run;

/* Print the result */
proc print data=mydata;
run;
What does this code do?

The data mydata; ... run; part creates a small dataset called mydata.

Inside, you assign values to variables a and b, and create a new variable c which is the sum of a and b.

The proc print step shows you a table with the results.

Example:
You can use this same method to do calculations with other variables.
For example, if you have blood pressure measured at two visits, you can calculate the average:

sas

Edit
data bp;
  visit1 = 120;
  visit2 = 130;
  avg_bp = (visit1 + visit2) / 2;
run;

proc print data=bp;
run;
This will show you the average blood pressure.

5. What is a Variable?
In SAS, a variable is like a column in a data table.
Each variable can be:

Character (text): Use quotes, like "Shweta" or "2"

Numeric: Numbers, no quotes, like 5, -2, or 22.56

6. Adding Comments
Use /* comment here */ or a single asterisk * comment; to add notes.

sas
Copy
Edit
/* This is a comment */
* This is also a comment;
7. Saving and Sharing
Click “Save As” to save your code as a .sas file.

Download your results or share them with others.

8. Common Beginner Tips
Always end each SAS statement with a semicolon ;

If you get an error, check for missing semicolons or typos.

The Log will tell you if your code ran successfully.
