Looking at Your Data: First Steps


We all use SAS, R, or Python mainly to analyze or manipulate datasets, not so much for data management or building databases from scratch.

Whenever you get a dataset, the best practice is to “look at” your data before starting any analysis. What does that mean?

Check the variables of interest: What columns (variables) are included in your dataset?

Check the distribution: What kind of values are there—numbers, text, missing data, weird values, etc.?

Understand the structure:

How many observations (rows) are there?

How many variables (columns) are there?

Are the columns and rows in the right order?

Sometimes your data might not be organized the way you expect (columns as variables  etc.). That’s called “transposing,” and we’ll cover how to handle that later.

In summary:

Always start by exploring your data—look at the size, structure, and what’s inside your variables before you jump into analysis.

So now we will learn how to explore the dataset for the type of value it is, mising data, mean and SD and number of obs and var.
