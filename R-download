Beginner Guide: Getting Started with R and RStudio
RStudio is a free, user-friendly tool to write and run R code. It’s great for beginners, especially for data science, statistics, or learning R for the first time.

1. What is RStudio?
An interactive coding tool: You can write code, add notes, and see results instantly.

Desktop app (or in your browser): It organizes your code, results, files, and plots in one place.

2. How to Start Using RStudio
This is what I use—you can also explore other options (like Posit Cloud, Jupyter with R, etc.).

Install R and RStudio (Recommended for Local Use):
Download and install R from CRAN.

Download and install RStudio Desktop from posit.co.

Open RStudio.

3. Understanding the Interface
Script Editor (top left): Write and save your code scripts here.

Console (bottom left): Type code and see results immediately.

Environment/History (top right): See your variables and what you’ve done so far.

Files/Plots/Packages/Help (bottom right): Access files, see plots, manage packages, or get help.

4. Writing and Running R Code
Type this in the Console or in a new script:

r
Copy
Edit
a <- 3
b <- 4
c <- a + b
c
print(c)
You will see the value 7 appear in the Console.

Tip:

When you type c alone, R shows the value of c.

print(c) also shows it.

5. What is a Variable?
Think of a variable as a container that can hold different values.

A value can be:

A string: Text, written inside quotation marks, like "2", "name", "25.6", or "age".

An integer: Whole numbers like -2, 2, 5, or 15.

A float (numeric): Numbers with decimals, like 22.56 or 559.23.

Just remember:

Strings: Use quotation marks (" ").

Numbers: Don’t use quotation marks for numbers.

6. Adding Notes and Comments
Use # at the start of a line to write comments (notes for yourself or others).

r
Copy
Edit
# This is a comment in R
7. Saving and Sharing
Click “File” → “Save” to save your script as a .R file.

You can also copy-paste your code and share it, or export your results.

8. Common Beginner Tips
Run code line by line with Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (Mac).

Save your work often.

If you see an error, check for typos or missing quotation marks.

Use the “Help” tab or ?functionname (e.g., ?mean) for documentation.

Assigning Values to Variables: R vs Python
In Python, you use the = sign to assign a value to a variable.

python
Copy
Edit
a = 5
name = "Shweta"
In R, you can use either the = sign or the <- symbol to assign a value.
However, most R users prefer <- because it’s the traditional R way.

r
Copy
Edit
a <- 5       # Recommended in R
name <- "Shweta"
# OR, you can also do:
a = 5        # Also works in R
name = "Shweta"
Tip: Both <- and = do the same thing in most situations in R, but <- is more common in R code and tutorials.
